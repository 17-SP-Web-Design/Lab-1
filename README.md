# Web Page Design - Spring 2018

## Lab-1 - The Good, The Bad, and the Internet

**Purpose:** To begin to learn how to look at a web site with a critical eye. To spot problems in user experience and to see things that work well in an effort to learn about things that you might want to emulate.

**Instructions:** Complete **Chapter 1 - Lab 1** on page 29 as written in the text except that you only have to do part 1, though we will take some time in class to informally address the other parts of the lab.

Use the file attached to this repository. You will have to make two copies of it and call them **lab1-1good.docx** and **lab1-1bad.docx**.

Upload your files back to this repository.
