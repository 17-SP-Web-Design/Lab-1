# Lab-1

Complete **Chapter 1 - Lab 1** on page 29 as written in the text except that you only have to do part 1, though we will take some time in class to informally address the other parts of the lab.

Use the file attached to this repository. You will have to make two copies of it and call them **lab1-1good.docx** and **lab1-1bad.docx**
